# The-Discovery-of-Handwashing
<br>
Prior to the nineteenth century, hygiene was frowned upon. People simply didn’t understand the risk of not washing their hands. This unreasonable behavior caused many deaths, especially in hospitals where most doctors—unlike today—never washed their hands before surgeries. In the mid-1800s, the Hungarian physician, Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, decided to do something about this tragedy. He started investigating the reasons behind the deaths in Vienna general hospital and those of women giving birth in particular. After analyzing data from Clinic 1 and Clinic 2, it turned out the proportion of deaths in Clinic 1 is much higher than that in Clinic 2.

By looking further into why this happened, Dr. Semmelweis realized that many of the medical students who worked at Clinic 1 also spend a lot of time in the autopsy room as a part of their studies. So, he realized that dealing with corpses spread harmful bacteria that was transferred to the women giving birth, thus infecting them with the deadly childbed fever - the main reason for the high mortality rates.
<br>
Dr. Semmelweis ordered the doctors to wash their hands in the summer of 1847. From that point onwards, the proportion of deaths decreased by around 6.7 to 10 percentage points. Truly impressive!
<br>
This project is a recreation of what he did in a modern way through the use of data science.
<br>
The objectives of this project are :

    Read a dataset and display records from it
    Display the relationship between variables through different periods
    Perform some calculations to create new variables
    Visualize the effect of handwashing on decreasing the number of deaths
